# Introduction
Thanks for considering to contribute to Acetate! Let's run though some of the basics here.

# Your First Contribution
### New to Open source?
Here are a couple of friendly tutorials you can look over: http://makeapullrequest.com/ and http://www.firsttimersonly.com/

* Unsure where to begin contributing? You can start by looking through issues and find ones labeled "good first issue":
* At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first :smile_cat:
* If a maintainer asks you to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that a lot of code has changed, and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge.

# Getting started

## Contributing
### A quick walkthrough of how to submit a contribution.

Whether it's a spelling error or a complete re-imagining of the UI, here's the process:

>1. Create your own fork of the code
>2. Make changes in your fork
>3. If you like the change and think the project could use it:
>   * Be sure you have followed the code style for the project.
>   * (Have ESLint run, see if it gives the all clear)
>   * Send a pull request!
>4. Unit tests are currently not implemented (soon though [#18]()) so don't worry about writing tests for now

### Commit message format
If you're working on an issue this is the commit message format "Commit description (#ISSUENUMBER)"

This guide was put together with the [contributing template from nayafia](https://github.com/nayafia/contributing-template/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING-template.md). if you've got a project of your own, I highly recommend it!

## How to report a bug
### Security Issues
> If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email `sreeve96 [at] gmail [dot] com` instead. Ensure the email subject clearly indicates that this is a security matter or it may be missed.

### File a bug report.
Found a bug? Please let me know about it by creating an issue and using this template,

> When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:
>
> 1. What browser (and browser version) are you using?
> 2. What operating system are you using?
> 3. What did you do?
> 4. What did you expect to see?
> 5. What did you see instead?
> 6. When did this happen?

# How to suggest a feature or enhancement
Acetate releases based on grouping a number of issues and working though them, when all the issues are complete, that version is then released (excluding urgent bug fixes etc.) So here's how to get your issue added to the current release or next.

### Suggesting a feature.
Throughout Acetate's development, there have been countless suggestions I never could have thought of, got one of your own?

- Open an issue
- Clearly write what it is your suggesting
- Add the label "Suggestion"

I'll take a look when I can, and we'll take it from there!

# Code review process
### How a contribution gets accepted after itâ€™s been submitted.
Taken things into your own hands and made something that you think could be added to Acetate? That's awesome!
To get it added to Acetate:

- Open a pull request and assign myself (@SamReeve96) to review it
- Double check that you've adhered to the contributing guide above
- Make sure you've clearly stated the intent of your pull request, and that the code associated is in line with that description
- I'll take a look, and go from there.
