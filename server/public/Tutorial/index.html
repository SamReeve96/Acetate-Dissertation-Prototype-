        <h1>Welcome to Acetate!</h1>
        <p class='alert'>Note: The extension currently doesn't play well with certain web apps like react.js .etc we'll be looking into it here" <a href='https://github.com/SamReeve96/Acetate/issues/64'>See on github</a></p>
        <p>Acetate is a tool that lets you annotate web pages.</p>
        <p>If Acetate is open you can annotate this very page!</p>
        <p>Just right click on an element or highlighted text and select "Annotate" in chrome's context menu</p>
        <p>This will create a card, click annotate to save the card</p>
        <p>If an element is annotated it will be highlighted and glow a colour (default is orange)</p>
        <p>Cards automatically get out of the way of content, want to see them? You can view them via a few different ways, 
            Either hover over a card on the right of the window, hover over an annotated element or press the "o" 
            (I promise I'll make this an actual shortcut soon.)</p>
        <p>You can even annotate some elements, try annotating this image to say how lovely it is</p>
